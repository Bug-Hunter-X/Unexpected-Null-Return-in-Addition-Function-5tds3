# Unexpected Null Return in JavaScript Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: unexpected null returns from functions.  The `foo` function is designed to add two numbers but returns `null` if either input is `null`. This behavior might be unexpected or lead to errors in other parts of the application.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.js` shows how to handle `null` inputs more robustly.
